# ðŸ“Š Project Report: Multi-Task Data Analysis

## Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

**Objective:** Explore and visualize the Iris dataset.

**Approach:** Used seaborn for visualizations including scatter plots, histograms, and boxplots.

**Results & Insights:** Identified correlations and distributions of flower features to support classification understanding.

## Task 2: Credit Risk Prediction

**Objective:** Predict credit risk using customer loan data.

**Approach:** Cleaned missing data, visualized key patterns, encoded features, and used Logistic Regression.

**Results & Insights:** Achieved a good accuracy level and highlighted the influence of education and income on loan amounts.

## Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction (Bank Customers)

**Objective:** Predict customer churn in a banking context.

**Approach:** Preprocessed data, used encoding, and trained a Random Forest classifier.

**Results & Insights:** Achieved high classification accuracy. Feature importance showed balance and age were major churn indicators.

## Task 4: Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts

**Objective:** Predict insurance charges using demographic data.

**Approach:** Encoded categorical variables and trained a Linear Regression model. Visualized relationships between features and charges.

**Results & Insights:** Smoking status had the most significant impact on charges. MAE and RMSE indicated reasonable model performance.

## Task 5: Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction

**Objective:** Predict personal loan acceptance.

**Approach:** Performed data exploration, applied one-hot encoding, trained a Logistic Regression model, and interpreted coefficients.

**Results & Insights:** Certain job types and education levels positively correlated with higher acceptance probability.
